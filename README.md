## Data Examination:

#### User Data Overview

The Excelerate registration dataset contains information about 27,563 users, which provides a rich picture of the audience. It has eight columns, out of which PreferredSponsors is included that shows the user preference for the opportunity recommendations and Gender consisting of the unspecified entries. At registration, the system saves user locations through fields such as Country, Degree, City, and Zip while the academic level is captured in the Degree field. signup_date records account creation and isFromSocialMedia indicates Google Login sign-ups. The dataset has 94 PreferredSponsors, 169 countries, and 4016 cities. Degrees are grouped into: Undergraduate, High School, Graduate Program, Not in Education, and null with corresponding values. Out of the above results we can see that manual login got 13742 users while Google login got 13811 users. The availability of such demographic data enhances the possibility of differentiated analyses of opportunities that may be available on Excelerate as well as helping to develop suitable engagement strategies. It goes further in providing information on user qualities for enhanced decision making. The depth of the dataset is beneficial in developing more accurate and effective approaches, taking into account different geographical and academic backgrounds, improving the strategies of the Excelerate platform.

#### Opportunity Sign Up Data Overview

The primary object of study is the “Opportunity Sign Up Data” data set, which provides an overview of user activity in the Excelerate environment. With 20,322 rows and 21 columns, each value represents a different interaction and consists of a combination of numerical, categorical, and datetime data for the analysis. The “Profile ID” acts as an important alphanumeric reference number allowing for tracking of learner activity across the various opportunities. Since users are capable of signing up for various opportunities, the dataset expects the term “Profile ID” to appear multiple times. Also, the ‘Opportunity ID,’ an alphanumeric number that is assigned to each opportunity, helps sort user interactions and is used as a point of reference in the backend operations, with 33 different opportunities recorded.
This dataset can be described as a vast and diverse terrain, where one can wander in search of patterns, solve data anomalies, and mine for gold. Moving forward, the focus will be on improving users’ experiences on the Excelerate platform using the aforementioned identifiers like “Profile ID” and “Opportunity ID” as key reference points to decode specific user interactions and differentiate between opportunities. In this analytical process, we aim to make a valuable addition to the overarching goal of enhancing user interactions on the Excelerate platform.

- More support staff should be available to handle more requests during the peak of registration in June as seen on the visualization "Registered User by Social Media Marketing".

#### Opportunity Sign Up Data

During the exploratory analysis of the Opportunity Sign Up Data, several initial observations and patterns emerged:

#### Status Distribution

The largest portion of the participants is in the “Team Allocated” state, which shows high rates of successful teaming.

There were a significant number of participants who did not get rewarded as the “Rewards Award” status depicted very low completion on the program.

The percentage of participants that have not even begun or have been turned down is quite high.

#### Profile IDs

There are Profile IDs of various users, which may or may not have a high level of interaction with the Excelerate platform. There are Profile IDs that are repeated, which implies that there are some people who have signed up for more than one opportunity.

#### Reward and Skill Points

The "Reward Amount" and "Skill Points Earned" columns exhibit wide ranges, with some participants receiving high rewards or earning a significant number of skill points. Negative values in the "Reward Amount" column suggest cases where participants were Withdrawn, Dropped Out, and Rejected.

#### Badge Information

The "Badge ID" column includes repetitions, indicating instances where multiple participants earned the same type of badge.


#### Missing Values

There were instances where certain columns in the dataset contained missing values, and depending on the type of information and the status of the participants’ description, different approaches were taken.


## Areas of Interest for Deeper Investigation:

#### Status Progression Analysis: 

- Examine how the participants demographically move from one status level to the other. Explore reasons for non initiation and refusal by the participants.

#### User Engagement Patterns:

- It remains possible to consider the frequency of engagements for users with multiple instances of the Profile IDs. 

- Examine potential users who have signed up for various opportunities.

#### Impact of Rewards and Skill Points:

- We also could investigate how rewards and skill points may influence the participants’ activity and results. 

- Research on instances where people did not get incentives despite participation.

#### Badge Achievements:

- Examine the importance and effectiveness of particular badges.

-Examine how the badge achievements are distributed and if there are any relationships with other participant characteristics.

#### Data Quality and Missing Values:

Make sure to perform a detailed inspection of cases with missing data and their effect on the analysis. Reflect on possible causes of missing values in particular columns and evaluate their significance.

These initial observations provide an outline for further examination in the next weeks, as the main goal is to collect more data regarding the participation rates, success levels, and the efficiency of opportunities within the Excelerate platform.
